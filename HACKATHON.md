## 🎯 What It Does

### The Problem

Modern professionals are drowning in information overload. They juggle multiple tools—calendars, emails, JIRA, Confluence, AWS consoles, incident management systems—each requiring separate logins, different interfaces, and manual context switching. A typical engineering manager might spend 30+ minutes each morning just gathering information to plan their day:

- Checking calendar for meetings
- Scanning emails for urgent items
- Reviewing JIRA tickets and blockers
- Monitoring incidents and AWS infrastructure
- Searching documentation for best practices

This fragmentation kills productivity and creates cognitive overhead. Traditional AI assistants fail here because they're single-agent systems that can't orchestrate complex, multi-source workflows.

### The Solution

**SideKick AI** is a hierarchical multi-agent productivity assistant that orchestrates 7 specialized AI agents to automate information gathering and decision support. Built on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, it demonstrates a novel **Agents-as-Tools** pattern where an Orchestrator agent coordinates specialized Worker agents, each expert in a specific domain.

**Key Capabilities:**

1. **Daily Briefing Orchestration**: Ask "Help me plan my day" and SideKick simultaneously queries your calendar, emails, JIRA tasks, incidents, and AWS infrastructure—then synthesizes a prioritized action plan in seconds.

2. **Intelligent Report Generation**: Request "Generate Q3 2025 sales report" and SideKick retrieves templates from Knowledge Bases, queries DynamoDB with natural language time parsing, and produces a professional report with insights.

3. **Multi-Source Research**: Ask about AWS costs, JIRA best practices, or incident runbooks, and SideKick aggregates information from Confluence, Knowledge Bases, and live AWS data.

4. **Read-Only AWS Safety**: SideKick can analyze your AWS infrastructure, estimate costs, and provide recommendations—but strictly enforces read-only operations for security.

**Business Impact:**
- **30+ minutes saved daily** on information gathering
- **Instant reports** that previously took hours
- **Zero context switching** between tools
- **Production-grade safety** with read-only AWS enforcement

### AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose | Innovation |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** | Agent runtime and orchestration | Containerized deployment with production-grade scaling |
| **Amazon Bedrock (Nova Pro/Lite)** | LLM inference | Nova Pro for orchestration, Nova Lite for workers (cost optimization) |
| **Bedrock Knowledge Bases** | RAG-powered document retrieval | Semantic search across templates, runbooks, best practices |
| **Bedrock Guardrails** | Content filtering and safety | PII protection, harmful content blocking |
| **ECS Fargate** | Chainlit UI hosting | Serverless container deployment |
| **DynamoDB** | Sales data storage | Intelligent query construction with natural language time parsing |
| **S3** | Document and template storage | Knowledge Base data source |
| **Secrets Manager** | OAuth token storage | Secure credential management |
| **CloudWatch** | Logging and monitoring | Centralized observability |
| **ACM** | SSL/TLS certificates | HTTPS encryption with auto-renewal |
| **IAM** | Security and permissions | Least-privilege access control |

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Agent Framework**: StrandsAgents 1.10.0 (Agents-as-Tools pattern)
- **Frontend**: Chainlit 2.8.1 (conversational UI with streaming)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK v2 (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 (Atlassian), Chainlit password auth
- **Region**: eu-central-1 (hard requirement for AgentCore)

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Hierarchical Architecture**: Instead of a monolithic agent, we use an Orchestrator + 7 Workers pattern. This enables parallel execution, specialized expertise, and clean separation of concerns.

2. **Agents-as-Tools Pattern**: Each Worker agent is wrapped as a callable tool for the Orchestrator. This leverages StrandsAgents 1.10.0's native support for agent composition.

3. **Model Selection**: Nova Pro for orchestration (complex reasoning), Nova Lite for workers (cost-effective, fast). This hybrid approach balances performance and cost.

4. **Read-Only AWS Enforcement**: All AWS operations are strictly read-only. The system can analyze infrastructure but never modify it—critical for production safety.

5. **Natural Language Time Parsing**: Custom DynamoDB Query Builder agent that translates "Q3 2025" or "third quarter" into precise date ranges and optimal query specifications.

6. **OAuth Integration**: Secure Atlassian API access with token storage in Secrets Manager, automatic refresh, and graceful fallback to demo data.

### Development Process

1. **Phase 1 - Foundation**: Built core Orchestrator and Calendar Worker with static data
2. **Phase 2 - Multi-Agent**: Added 6 additional workers with Agents-as-Tools pattern
3. **Phase 3 - AWS Integration**: Deployed to Bedrock AgentCore with CDK infrastructure
4. **Phase 4 - Production Features**: Added OAuth, Knowledge Bases, Guardrails, HTTPS
5. **Phase 5 - Hackathon Prep**: Documentation, demo scenarios, testing, polish

## 💪 Challenges We Ran Into

### 1. Natural Language Time Parsing for DynamoDB Queries

**Challenge**: Users say "Q3 2025" or "third quarter" but DynamoDB needs precise ISO timestamps. Naive string matching fails for variations like "3rd quarter 2025" or "July-September 2025".

**Solution**: Built a dedicated DynamoDB Query Builder agent that:
- Parses natural language time expressions using regex patterns
- Converts to ISO 8601 timestamps with timezone handling
- Constructs optimal DynamoDB query specifications
- Handles edge cases (fiscal vs calendar quarters, timezone offsets)

**Result**: Users can query sales data naturally without knowing DynamoDB syntax.

### 2. DynamoDB Type Descriptors in Query Construction

**Challenge**: DynamoDB's Query API requires type descriptors (`{"S": "value"}` for strings, `{"N": "123"}` for numbers). Incorrect types cause cryptic errors.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic schema discovery:
- Query Builder agent calls `describe_table` to get attribute types
- Maps DynamoDB types (S, N, BOOL, etc.) to Python types
- Automatically wraps values with correct type descriptors
- Validates query specifications before execution

**Result**: Zero manual type descriptor management—queries just work.

### 3. Read-Only AWS Enforcement Without Blocking Legitimate Operations

**Challenge**: Need to prevent destructive operations (delete S3 bucket, terminate EC2) while allowing read operations (list buckets, describe instances). Simple keyword blocking is too brittle.

**Solution**: Whitelist approach with explicit allowed operations:
- Defined comprehensive list of safe read-only AWS API calls
- Implemented operation validation before execution
- Added clear error messages explaining why operations are blocked
- Documented safety guarantees prominently

**Result**: Users can safely explore AWS infrastructure without risk of accidental modifications.

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration and Context Management

**Challenge**: Orchestrator needs to route queries to appropriate workers, handle parallel execution, and synthesize results—without losing context or creating circular dependencies.

**Solution**: Agents-as-Tools pattern with StrandsAgents:
- Each worker is a self-contained agent with clear input/output contracts
- Orchestrator uses semantic routing to select appropriate workers
- Workers return structured data that Orchestrator synthesizes
- No shared state between workers—clean functional composition

**Result**: Reliable multi-agent coordination with parallel execution and coherent responses.

### 5. OAuth Token Management with Secrets Manager

**Challenge**: OAuth tokens expire and need refresh. Storing tokens insecurely risks credential leakage. Manual token refresh disrupts user experience.

**Solution**: Integrated AWS Secrets Manager with automatic refresh:
- Store access and refresh tokens in Secrets Manager
- Implement automatic token refresh on expiration
- Graceful fallback to demo data if OAuth not configured
- Clear error messages guide users through OAuth setup

**Result**: Seamless authentication with production-grade security.

## 📚 What We Learned

### 1. Hierarchical Architectures Scale Better Than Monolithic Agents

**Insight**: A single large agent becomes unwieldy as capabilities grow. The Orchestrator + Workers pattern provides:
- **Modularity**: Each worker is independently testable and deployable
- **Specialization**: Workers can use different models (Nova Pro vs Lite)
- **Parallelization**: Multiple workers execute simultaneously
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one worker don't affect others

**Takeaway**: For complex systems, invest in hierarchical architecture from day one.

### 2. Safety Constraints Can Be Features, Not Limitations

**Insight**: Read-only AWS enforcement initially felt restrictive, but users appreciated the safety guarantee. It became a selling point: "Explore your infrastructure without fear."

**Takeaway**: Frame constraints as features. Users value safety and predictability.

### 3. Natural Language Interfaces Need Intelligent Parsing

**Insight**: Users don't think in API terms. They say "Q3 2025" not "2025-07-01T00:00:00Z to 2025-09-30T23:59:59Z". Building a Query Builder agent to translate natural language to precise queries was essential.

**Takeaway**: Invest in natural language understanding for user-facing features.

### 4. RAG Quality Depends on Document Structure

**Insight**: Early Knowledge Base documents were unstructured text. Retrieval quality improved dramatically when we added:
- Clear section headers
- Bullet points for key information
- Examples and code snippets
- Metadata (tags, categories)

**Takeaway**: Document structure matters as much as content for RAG.

### 5. OAuth Is Complex But Worth It

**Insight**: Implementing OAuth 2.0 took longer than expected (token refresh, error handling, secure storage). But the result—seamless Atlassian API access—was worth the investment.

**Takeaway**: Don't underestimate OAuth complexity. Plan for token management, refresh, and error handling.

### 6. Bedrock AgentCore Simplifies Deployment

**Insight**: Moving from ECS Fargate to Bedrock AgentCore eliminated infrastructure complexity:
- No VPC, subnets, security groups to manage
- No load balancer configuration
- No auto-scaling policies
- Just: build container, push to ECR, deploy agent

**Takeaway**: AgentCore is a game-changer for agent deployment. Use it.

### 7. Demo Data Quality Matters

**Insight**: Early demos used obviously fake data ("Test User", "Sample Task"). Judges and users didn't engage. Switching to realistic data (real names, plausible scenarios) made demos compelling.

**Takeaway**: Invest in high-quality demo data. It's the difference between "toy project" and "production-ready".
