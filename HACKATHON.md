## What It Does

### The Problem

Modern professionals are drowning in information overload:
- **Scattered Information**: Critical data lives in calendars, emails, JIRA, Confluence, AWS dashboards, and incident systems
- **Context Switching**: Constantly jumping between 10+ tools wastes hours daily
- **Manual Aggregation**: Creating daily plans or reports requires tedious copy-paste from multiple sources
- **Reactive Workflows**: Teams respond to issues instead of proactively planning
- **AWS Complexity**: Monitoring infrastructure requires deep technical knowledge and multiple console tabs

### The Solution

SideKick AI is a **hierarchical multi-agent productivity assistant** that orchestrates specialized AI agents to solve these problems:

**üéØ Single Conversational Interface**: Ask "Help me plan my day" and get a comprehensive briefing aggregating:
- Today's calendar events with meeting details
- Urgent emails with extracted action items
- JIRA tasks (blocked, in-progress, ready to start)
- Overnight incidents requiring attention
- AWS infrastructure alerts and cost anomalies

**ü§ñ Intelligent Agent Orchestration**: The Orchestrator agent coordinates 7 specialized workers that execute in parallel:
- **Calendar Worker**: Meeting schedules and conflicts
- **Email Worker**: Action item extraction with NLP
- **JIRA Worker**: Task management with OAuth
- **Incident Worker**: Critical issue monitoring
- **AWS Worker**: Infrastructure monitoring (read-only)
- **Knowledge Base Worker**: RAG-powered document retrieval
- **Report Worker**: Multi-source report generation

**üõ°Ô∏è Production-Grade Safety**: 
- Read-only AWS enforcement (analyze but never modify)
- Bedrock Guardrails for content filtering
- OAuth 2.0 secure authentication
- AgentCore Identity for token storage

**üìä Business Value**:
- **3+ hours saved daily** on information aggregation
- **Proactive planning** instead of reactive firefighting
- **Reduced context switching** with single interface
- **Faster incident resolution** with multi-source correlation
- **Data-driven decisions** with intelligent report generation

## How We Built It

### Technical Architecture

**Hierarchical Multi-Agent System** using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore:

```
User ‚Üí Chainlit UI ‚Üí Orchestrator Agent ‚Üí 7 Specialized Worker Agents
                            ‚Üì
                    Amazon Bedrock (Nova Pro/Lite)
                    Bedrock Knowledge Bases (RAG)
                    Bedrock Guardrails (Safety)
                            ‚Üì
                    DynamoDB, S3, Secrets Manager

## Challenges We Ran Into

### 1. AgentCore Integration Complexity

**Challenge**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore was new (launched 2024) with limited documentation and examples.

**Solution**:
- Used L1 CDK constructs (`CfnRuntime`) for fine-grained control
- Implemented custom deployment scripts with ECR authentication
- Created comprehensive error handling and CloudWatch logging
- Documented complete migration guide for future developers

**Learning**: Early adoption of cutting-edge AWS services requires patience and experimentation, but delivers competitive advantage.

---

### 2. OAuth Token Management

**Challenge**: Securely storing and refreshing OAuth tokens for Atlassian (JIRA/Confluence) integration.

**Solution**:
- Leveraged AgentCore Identity for secure token storage
- Implemented automatic token refresh logic
- Created fallback to static demo data when OAuth not configured
- Built comprehensive validation scripts

**Learning**: AWS services often have hidden gems (AgentCore Identity) that solve complex problems elegantly.

---

### 3. DynamoDB Query Intelligence

**Challenge**: Users ask questions like "Show me Q3 2025 sales" but DynamoDB requires precise date ranges.

**Solution**:
- Built dedicated Query Builder support agent
- Implemented natural language time parsing (quarters, months, relative dates)
- Automatic schema discovery to construct optimal queries
- Adaptive aggregations based on data patterns

**Innovation**: This is a unique capability not found in traditional database query tools.

---

### 4. Parallel Agent Execution

**Challenge**: Daily briefing requires data from 5+ sources, sequential execution was too slow (15+ seconds).

**Solution**:
- Leveraged Agents-as-Tools pattern for parallel execution
- Orchestrator delegates to multiple workers simultaneously
- Reduced execution time to 3-5 seconds
- Visible multi-agent orchestration in UI

**Learning**: Hierarchical architecture enables performance optimization through parallelization.

---

### 5. Read-Only AWS Safety

**Challenge**: Giving AI access to AWS infrastructure is risky - one wrong command could delete production resources.

**Solution**:
- Strictly enforced read-only operations at adapter layer
- Only allow list/describe/get operations
- Block all create/update/delete/terminate operations
- Clear error messages when destructive operations attempted

**Innovation**: Demonstrates responsible AI design - analyze and recommend, but never execute destructive changes.
