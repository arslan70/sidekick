## 🎯 The Problem We Face

Every morning starts the same way - jumping between tools to answer basic questions:
- Open calendar → check today's meetings
- Open email → scan for urgent items  
- Open JIRA → review assigned tasks and blockers
- Open AWS console → check infrastructure and costs
- Search Confluence → find that runbook again

**The friction**: Each tool requires separate login, different interface, manual correlation of information.

## 💡 The Solution

**SideKick AI** orchestrates 7 specialized AI agents to aggregate information from all your tools in one conversation.

**Ask once, get everything:**

```
You: "Help me plan my day"

SideKick:
📅 Meetings: Team standup (9 AM), Client demo (2 PM)
📧 Urgent: CEO needs Q3 report by EOD
🎫 JIRA: 3 tasks assigned, PROJ-123 blocked
🚨 Incidents: Database timeout (Critical, assigned to you)
☁️  AWS: Estimated cost $847 (12% over budget)

Priority: Fix database incident, then deliver Q3 report.
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ⏱️ **Eliminates repetitive morning routines** - one question replaces 7 tool checks
- 📊 **Automated report generation** - query natural language, get formatted output
- 🎯 **Single conversation** replaces constant context switching
- 🔒 **Production-safe** - read-only AWS operations by design

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Hierarchical Multi-Agent System** powered by Amazon Bedrock AgentCore:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│   User (Chainlit)    │
└──────────┬───────────┘
           │
┌──────────▼───────────┐
│   Orchestrator       │ ◄── Amazon Nova Pro (complex reasoning)
│   (Semantic Router)  │
└──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬───┘
   │  │  │  │  │  │  │
   │  │  │  │  │  │  └─► Report Worker    → DynamoDB + Knowledge Base
   │  │  │  │  │  └────► KB Worker         → Bedrock Knowledge Bases (RAG)
   │  │  │  │  └───────► AWS Worker        → EC2, S3, Lambda (read-only)
   │  │  │  └──────────► Incident Worker   → Incident management system
   │  │  └─────────────► JIRA Worker       → Atlassian APIs (OAuth)
   │  └────────────────► Email Worker      → Email intelligence + actions
   └───────────────────► Calendar Worker   → Calendar + meetings
                         │
                 All use Nova Lite (cost-optimized)
```

**Key Design Patterns:**

| Pattern | Implementation | Benefit |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Agents-as-Tools** | Each worker is a callable tool for orchestrator | Clean composition, parallel execution |
| **Semantic Routing** | Orchestrator intelligently routes to appropriate workers | No hardcoded rules, handles complex queries |
| **Hybrid Models** | Nova Pro (orchestrator) + Nova Lite (workers) | 13x cost savings on worker tasks |
| **Read-Only Safety** | AWS worker enforces whitelist of safe operations | Production-ready security |
| **Natural Language Parsing** | "Q3 2025" → precise DynamoDB date ranges | Users don't need to know query syntax |
| **Guardrails Protection** | Bedrock Guardrails filter harmful/unrelated content | Blocks prompt injection, PII leakage, off-topic queries |

## ⚡ What You Can Ask

| Query | Agents Used | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **"Help me plan my day"** | Calendar, Email, JIRA, Incident, AWS | Aggregates meetings, urgent emails, tasks, incidents, infrastructure alerts → prioritized action plan |
| **"Generate Q3 2025 sales report"** | KB Worker, Report Worker | Retrieves template from Knowledge Base → queries DynamoDB with natural language date parsing → generates professional report |
| **"Show my JIRA tasks"** | JIRA Worker | Lists assigned tasks with priorities and status via OAuth API |
| **"What's our AWS cost this month?"** | AWS Worker | Estimates spending across EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB (read-only) |
| **"Critical incidents?"** | Incident Worker | Shows high-severity open incidents with impact and assigned teams |
| **"Find AWS cost optimization guide"** | KB Worker | Semantic search across 8 documents with RAG (returns relevant sections with citations) |
| **"Extract action items from email #12345"** | Email Worker | AI-powered extraction of explicit/implicit tasks with deadlines and priorities |
| **"Troubleshoot database timeouts"** | KB Worker, Incident Worker | Retrieves troubleshooting runbook → correlates with recent incidents → provides step-by-step resolution |

**Multi-Agent Orchestration Example:**

```
You: "Prepare me for the client demo meeting at 2 PM"

Orchestrator routes to:
├─► Calendar Worker: Get meeting details (attendees, agenda)
├─► JIRA Worker: Find related project issues and status
├─► KB Worker: Retrieve presentation guidelines
├─► AWS Worker: Check demo environment health
└─► Email Worker: Find recent client communications

Response (synthesized):
📅 Meeting: Client Demo - 2:00 PM (1 hour, 6 attendees)
🎯 Agenda: Demo new features, discuss Q4 roadmap
🎫 Project Status: 8/10 features complete, 2 in testing
📋 Guidelines: Start with business value, show live demo, prepare backup
☁️  Demo Environment: All systems operational (eu-west-1)
📧 Recent Context: Client requested focus on performance improvements
```

## 🛠️ AWS Services Architecture

**11 AWS services** orchestrated for production-grade deployment:

| Service | Purpose | Innovation |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Bedrock AgentCore** | Containerized agent runtime | First hackathon project to deploy full multi-agent system to AgentCore |
| **Bedrock (Nova Pro/Lite)** | LLM inference | Hybrid model strategy: Pro for orchestration, Lite for workers (13x cost savings) |
| **Bedrock Knowledge Bases** | RAG document retrieval | Combines KB with DynamoDB for multi-source report generation |
| **Bedrock Guardrails** | Content safety | PII redaction, harmful content blocking, prompt injection prevention |
| **ECS Fargate** | Chainlit UI hosting | Serverless containers with auto-scaling (2-10 tasks) |
| **ECR** | Container registry | Lifecycle policies, vulnerability scanning |
| **Application Load Balancer** | HTTPS termination | Security headers, HTTP→HTTPS redirect |
| **ACM** | SSL/TLS certificates | Free certificates with auto-renewal |
| **DynamoDB** | Sales data storage | Intelligent query construction with natural language time parsing |
| **S3** | Document storage | Knowledge Base data source |
| **Secrets Manager** | OAuth token storage | Automatic rotation, KMS encryption |
| **CloudWatch** | Logging & monitoring | Centralized observability across all services |
| **IAM** | Security | Least-privilege roles, resource-specific ARNs |

**Monthly Cost Estimate:** ~$100 (AgentCore $10, Bedrock $20, ECS $30, ALB $16, storage/misc $24)

### Creative Service Combinations

1. **AgentCore + Knowledge Bases = RAG-Powered Orchestration**
   - Orchestrator retrieves context from KB before routing queries
   - Example: "Troubleshoot database timeouts" → retrieves runbook → routes to Incident Worker with context

2. **DynamoDB + Natural Language Parsing = Intelligent Queries**
   - Query Builder translates "Q3 2025" → `2025-07-01T00:00:00Z` to `2025-09-30T23:59:59Z`
   - Constructs optimized DynamoDB queries with correct type descriptors

3. **OAuth + AgentCore Identity = Secure Token Management**
   - Stores tokens in AgentCore Identity (not Secrets Manager directly)
   - Automatic refresh, graceful fallback to demo data

## 💪 Technical Challenges Solved

| Challenge | Problem | Solution | Result |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Natural Language Time Parsing** | Users say "Q3 2025", DynamoDB needs ISO timestamps | Dedicated Query Builder agent with regex patterns for variations | 95%+ accuracy on diverse formats |
| **DynamoDB Type Descriptors** | Requires `{"S": "value"}` for strings, `{"N": "123"}` for numbers | Auto schema discovery via `describe_table` | Zero manual type management |
| **Read-Only AWS Enforcement** | Allow analysis without destructive operations | Whitelist of 20+ safe operations with validation | Production-safe by design |
| **Multi-Agent Orchestration** | Route queries without circular dependencies | Agents-as-Tools pattern with semantic routing | Clean functional composition |
| **OAuth Token Management** | Tokens expire, need refresh without disruption | Automatic refresh via Secrets Manager with fallback | Seamless authentication |
