## 1. Presentation Structure

### The Classic Framework: Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Action

```
1. Opening (10%)
   - Hook: Grab attention
   - Context: Set the stage
   - Objective: State your purpose

2. Body (70%)
   - Problem/Opportunity
   - Analysis/Evidence
   - Solution/Recommendation
   - Implementation Plan

3. Closing (20%)
   - Summary of key points
   - Call to action
   - Q&A
```

### Executive Presentations (C-Level)
**Time Allocation**:
- Executive Summary: 30 seconds
- Key Findings: 2 minutes
- Recommendations: 2 minutes
- Next Steps: 1 minute

**Rule**: If you only have 30 seconds, what are the 3 things they must remember?

## 2. Slide Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Title**: Clear, action-oriented (18-24pt)
2. **Main Point**: One key message per slide (14-18pt)

4. **Citations**: Small, unobtrusive (8-10pt)

### The 6-6 Rule
- Maximum 6 bullet points per slide
- Maximum 6 words per bullet point
- If you need more, use multiple slides

### Color Psychology
- **Blue**: Trust, professionalism (primary)
- **Green**: Growth, success (positive metrics)
- **Red**: Urgency, decline (negative metrics)
- **Orange**: Action, call-to-attention
- **Gray**: Neutral, data

### Font Best Practices
‚úÖ **Recommended**:
- Sans-serif fonts (Helvetica, Arial, Calibri)
- Consistent sizing throughout
- High contrast (dark text on light background)

‚ùå **Avoid**:
- Serif fonts for body text
- All caps (except titles)
- Light text on light backgrounds
